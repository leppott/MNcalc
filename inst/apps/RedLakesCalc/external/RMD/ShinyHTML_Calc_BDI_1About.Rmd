# Purpose
The BioDiversity Index was developed for moderate to high gradient, low to 
mid-elevation streams in the Pacific Northwest Maritime Region with coarse 
mineral substrates and extensive erosional habitat. It can be used to help 
identify sites with high habitat complexity and resilience to disturbance that 
support macroinvertebrate communities with high and/or unique taxa richness 
representative of a BCG level 1 stream. During preliminary evaluations, there 
was good correspondence between Biodiversity Index scores and BCG model outputs 
(index scores followed the expected pattern, with highest median index scores 
occurring in BCG level 2 samples and lowest in BCG level 5-6 samples). 
Practitioners can use both tools together to help to identify sites that harbor 
exemplary biodiversity and help inform prioritization of sites for protection.

The BioDiversity Index is a multi-metric index calculated with the metrics and 
scoring criteria shown in Table 1, and the accompanying narrative ratings in 
Table 2. For more information, view this [PDF](links/BCGLevel1_BiodiversityIndex_MaritimePNW_4-19-2019.pdf) and

Table 2. BCG Level 1 Biodiversity Index (draft, version 1) – overall scores and 
ratings, as well as recommendations.

|Rating	|Score	|Description|
|:------|:------|:----------|
|High	  |≥ 30   |	Exemplary biodiversity and high habitat complexity and resilience probable. Acquire additional information and data on the site and watershed that is readily available. Alert stakeholders, including government and non-government organization conservation agencies.|
|Medium	|21-29  |	Moderate habitat complexity/resilience and biodiversity indicated. Further evaluation of the site and watershed is recommended.|
|Low	  |<20    |	Unexceptional biodiversity indicated. Mostly widespread and common taxa present.|

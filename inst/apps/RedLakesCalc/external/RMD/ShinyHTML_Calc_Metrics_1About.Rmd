The thermal preference metric calculator calculates three types of metrics (number of taxa, % taxa and % individuals) for seven thermal preference categories: 

*	Cold stenotherm

*	Cold

*	Cool

*	Cool/warm

*	Warm

*	Warm stenotherm

*	Eurythermal

Thermal preference assignments from Stamp et al. (in progress)  
[are available](ORWA_Shinyapp_ThermPref_20220914.xlsx) but not yet citable. They are based on a large benthic macroinvertebrate dataset from freshwater wadeable streams in Oregon and Washington and the Maximum Weekly Maximum Temperature (MWMT) metric from the 
<a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/rm/boise/AWAE/projects/NorWeST/ModeledStreamTemperatureScenarioMaps.shtml" target="_blank">NorWeST modeled stream temperature dataset</a>.
Samples were collected from June-October. Stamp et al. employed a systematic, data-driven and repeatable approach to assign 532 taxa to the seven thermal preference categories listed above.

More metrics (beyond thermal indicators) are available in the BioMonTools R package. You can request the addition of new metrics to the R package or Shiny app by emailing Erik (Erik.Leppo@tetratech.com) or posting your request on the

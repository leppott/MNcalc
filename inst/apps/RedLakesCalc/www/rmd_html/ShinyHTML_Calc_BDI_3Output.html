<p>A single zip file will be available for download. It will include all
result files along the the original data file. All result data files
will be CSV format.</p>
<p>The zip file will included the base name of the original file along
with the date and time.</p>
<p>The individual files will include the same basename along with a
suffix to represent each step of the calculation process.</p>
<p>The entire criteria file is included to allow the user to check for
non-matching Index Name and/or criteria columns.</p>
<p>As an example if the input file was “xxx.csv” the result files will
look like those in the table below.</p>

original input file with an ‘EXCLUDE’ taxa column added in. It is a
TRUE/FALSE field in which R marks redundant taxa as ‘TRUE’ based on the
phylogeny fields in the input file. All ‘Exclude’ decisions are
sample-specific. A detailed description of the process that the R tool
uses for marking redundant taxa is available upon request (<a href="mailto:Jen.Stamp@tetratech.com" class="email">Jen.Stamp@tetratech.com</a>)

# Purpose

The fuzzy set temperature model is an exploratory model. Instead of assigning 
macroinvertebrate samples to a BCG level, it assigns them to one of the 
following temperature classes:

*	VERY COLD

*	COLD

*	COOL

*	WARM

The model works the same way as a BCG model, with an output that includes
probability of membership in a primary and secondary class. Input metrics 
include:

*	number cold stenotherm taxa

*	number cold stenotherm + cold taxa

*	percent cold stenotherm + cold taxa

*	percent cold stenotherm + cold indiv

*	percent warm + warm stenotherm taxa

*	percent warm + warm stenotherm indiv

The thermal preference metrics are based on assignments from Stamp et al. 
(in progress), which were derived from an analysis of a large benthic 
macroinvertebrate dataset from freshwater wadeable streams in Oregon and 
Washington coupled with the Maximum Weekly Maximum Temperature (MWMT) metric 
from the 
<a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/rm/boise/AWAE/projects/NorWeST/ModeledStreamTemperatureScenarioMaps.shtml" target="_blank">NorWeST modeled stream temperature dataset</a>.

model and to view the box plots that helped inform selection of metrics and 
thresholds. For more information, contact Jen Stamp (Tetra Tech)

# Input File

There are two pathways to creating the input file:

1.	Generate a file outside of the Shiny app that is ready to go (has all the 
required fields, with exact column heading names – see the Calc_FuzzySet_Input 
subtab for details)

2.	Use the File Builder functions to create an input file (minimum required 
fields = SampleID, TaxonID, Count)

Using the File Builder option ensures that you are using proper Operational 
Taxonomic Units (OTUs) and attributes for the Fuzzy Set calculation.

IMPORTANT: 
Your input file needs to include the following two fields (which the File 
Builder function does not automatically populate - you’ll need to add them in 
manually) -

*	INDEX_NAME = Therm_ORWA_Bugs500ct

*	INDEX_CLASS = orwa

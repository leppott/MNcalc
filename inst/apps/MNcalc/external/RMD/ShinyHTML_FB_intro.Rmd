# **Preparing input files**

Input files must be comma-separated values (CSV). There are two options
for preparing input files:

**Option 1**: Use the File Builder 'Operational Taxonomic Unit (OTU)
Attribute Assignment' function to ensure that you are using the proper
taxa attributes for the BCG calculation. See the **Within the App: File
Builder** subtab for details.

**Option 2**: Generate a file outside of the Shiny app that is ready to
go (i.e., has all the required fields, with exact column heading names).
See the **Outside the app** subtab for details.

After you prepare the input file, go to the **Import Files** tab, upload
your input file, and calculate the BCG in the **Calculation** tab.

**About**

This R-based tool calculates Biological Condition Gradient (BCG) and
Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) scores for macroinvertebrate and
fish assemblages in Minnesota streams.

Users do not need R on their computers to run the app, nor do they need
to have any familiarity with R.

Requirements:

-   Internet access\*

-   Intermediate-level computer skills (need to be able to browse,
    upload and download files, unzip files)

For those who prefer to work with R, the functions are carried out by
the
<a href="https://github.com/leppott/BCGcalc" target="_blank">BCGcalc</a>
and
<a href="https://github.com/leppott/BioMonTools" target="_blank">BioMonTools</a>
R packages, which are available on GitHub and were developed by Erik W.
Leppo from Tetra Tech ([Erik.Leppo\@tetratech.com](#0)).

\*If using the R code instead of the Shiny app, you won’t need internet
access if you have R installed on your computer and have downloaded all
the necessary packages.

**Workflow**

**Time saver tip:**

Some internet browsers, like Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox, allow
you to change settings so that you can select which folder to download
files to (versus files going to the default Download folder).

    \> Check box for “always ask where to save files.”

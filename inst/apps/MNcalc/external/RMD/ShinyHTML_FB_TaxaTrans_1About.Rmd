# Prepare an input file with *File Builder*

EXAMPLE INPUT FILES
[<a href="https://github.com/leppott/MNcalc/raw/main/inst/apps/MNcalc/www/links/Test1Files_FileBuilder.zip" target="blank">ZIP</a>]

The File Builder joins the taxon name in the input file with the
‘original taxaID’ column in the [Taxa Translator
table](https://github.com/leppott/BioMonTools_SupportFiles/tree/main/data/taxa_official/MN)
and performs two functions:

-   Translates the original taxon name to the proper OTU for the
    calculation (for example, collapses worms to Oligochaeta).

-   Adds in new columns with taxa attributes and hierarchy (e.g., Order,
    Family) that are needed for the metric calculations.

The input file must be a comma-separated file (CSV).

<a href="https://github.com/leppott/MNcalc/raw/main/inst/apps/MNcalc/www/links/IndexClass_MN_20240626.csv" target="blank">Index
Name and Index Class</a> are required for all calculations (they tell R
which BCG rules and IBI metrics to apply).

Some columns are required for all calculations, and others are specific
to a particular calculation. Allowable entries are shown in the table at
the bottom of the page.

Required fields for all calculations. Column names are flexible (use
drop-down menus to match).

```{r table_req}
# Packages
library(readxl)
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)

# Data
fn <- "BCGcalc_ReqFields_20230203.xlsx"
path <- file.path("files", fn)
df <- read_excel(path, sheet = "MN_Req_AllCalc")

options(knitr.kable.NA = '')
df %>%
  kable() %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = F, position = "left")
```

Additional required fields for specific calculations . Column names must
match exactly with what is shown here.

```{r table_req2}
# Packages
library(readxl)
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)

# Data
fn <- "BCGcalc_ReqFields_20230203.xlsx"
path <- file.path("files", fn)
df <- read_excel(path, sheet = "MN_Req_SomeCalc")

options(knitr.kable.NA = '')
df %>%
  kable() %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = F, position = "left")
```

Optional fields (e.g., SiteID, latitude, longitude, collection date) can
be selected as well and will be carried through into the output file.

IMPORTANT! Do not repeat columns (e.g., do not include SampleID and
Taxon Name twice), and do not include Life Stage or other fields that
might cause a taxon to occur in more than one row for a given sample
(which could lead to double-counting of that taxon in the richness
metrics).

Below are the metadata associated with each column listed in the
previous tables.

```{r table_req3}
# Packages
library(readxl)
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)

# Data
fn <- "BCGcalc_ReqFields_20230203.xlsx"
path <- file.path("files", fn)
df <- read_excel(path, sheet = "MN_Req_Metadata")

options(knitr.kable.NA = '')
df %>%
  kable(escape = FALSE, format = "html") %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = F, position = "left")
```

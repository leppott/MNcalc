# Introduction

The MN Biological Condition Gradient (BCG) is divided into six levels of
biological condition along a generalized stressor-response curve, ranging from
observable biological conditions found at no or low levels of stressors (level 
1) to those found at high levels of stressors (level 6) (Figure 1) 
(<a href="https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2016-02/documents/bcg-practioners-guide-report.pdf" target="blank">USEPA 2016</a>).

The Shiny app will perform the following steps:

1.	Mark non-distinct taxa (excluded from richness metrics)

2.	Calculate metric values for each sample

3.	Calculate BCG metric membership values for each sample [<a href="https://github.com/leppott/MNcalc/raw/main/inst/apps/MNcalc/www/links/_BCG_MetricScoring_Explanation_20240725.pdf" target="blank">PDF</a>]

4.	Assign each sample membership in a BCG level

Examples of bug and fish BCG rules can be found in the bug and fish subtabs. Together the rules for each BCG level work as a cascade from BCG level 1 to level 6, such that a sample is first tested against the level 1 rules; if the combined rule fails, then the level fails, and the assessment moves down to level 2, and so on. A sample can have full membership in a single BCG level, a tie between two levels or varying memberships among two or more levels (in which case, the level with the highest membership value is taken as the nominal level).

BCG results include the following fields:
```{r}
# Packages
library(readxl)
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
#library(DT)

# Data
fn <- "CalculateBCGmodels_Introduction_ResultsFiles_20241002.xlsx"
path <- file.path("files", fn)
df <- read_excel(path, sheet = "Sheet1")

df %>%
  kable(escape = FALSE, format = "html") %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = F, position = "left")
```

IMPORTANT: Data must be collected using MPCA field and laboratory protocols (see MPCA 2017 reports on the References page).

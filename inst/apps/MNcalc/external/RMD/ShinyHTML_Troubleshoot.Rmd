# Troubleshooting

If you encounter problems and/or have suggestions on ways to further
improve this Shiny app, please contact Erik W. Leppo from Tetra Tech via
email ([Erik.Leppo\@tetratech.com](mailto:Erik.Leppo@tetratech.com)) or
via a post on the
`<a href="https://github.com/leppott/`{=html}BCGcalc/discussions`" target="_blank">`{=html}BCGcalc
GitHub Discussions</a> page.

Most common problems

-   Forgetting to include all the required fields in the input file.

-   Forgetting to import file \# 2 after using the File Builder
    function.

-   If running multiple calculators during the same session, forgetting
    to reset the calculation type in the drop-down menu. For example, if
    you run the bug IBI followed by the fish IBI, the bug IBI selection
    does not automatically clear if you don’t refresh the webpage, so
    don’t forget to select the fish IBI.

-   When unzipping files, sometimes users have problems with the
    Microsoft default zip extractor (not sure why). If you can use 7zip
    instead, that seems to work better (free download:
    <https://www.7-zip.org/>).

-   Including blank rows in File Builder input files. This will trigger
    non-matches with the taxa translator table. You can’t see the blank
    rows when you open the file in Excel, but you can see them if you
    open the file in Notepad. The extra rows happen for a variety of
    reasons. Commonly, the user is working in Excel, removes data from
    the bottom row(s), hits delete and then saves the file as a CSV.
    While the cell contents in the bottom row(s) are gone, they are
    still considered part of your data range and when you save the file
    as a CSV, the extra rows are retained. R imports any CSV "as is" and
    assumes any blank rows are there on purpose. To correct this, open
    the file in Excel, delete the rows in question (vs. deleting
    contents) and resave as a CSV.

-   Saving files as ‘CSV UTF-8’ instead of ‘CSV.’ Input files must be
    CSV.

-   Including non-ASCII characters in your input file (for example,
    Mesenchytraeusá). R will reject these.

# Purpose
Merge (append) two sets of zipped CSV files.  It is assumed that all files are 
CSV, files are named the same, and have the same column names.

* File Set A (Primary)

* File Set B (Secondary)

All rows and columns in File Set A (Primary) and File Set B (Secondary) will be
carried through into the output files.

Each matching pair of file names will have the corresponding file from File Set
B appended to the same file name from File Set A.

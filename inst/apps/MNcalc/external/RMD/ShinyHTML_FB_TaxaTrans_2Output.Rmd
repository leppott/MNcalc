```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE
                      , results = 'asis'

A single zip file will be available for download. It will include all result
files, reference files, and the original input data file. All result data files will be CSV 
format.

The zip file will included the base name of the original file along with the 
date and time.

The individual files and their contents are output in three subfolders. Each output file is described in the table below.

```{r}
# Packages
library(readxl)
library(knitr)

# Data
fn_data <- "OutputFileSubtabs.xlsx"
path_data <- file.path("files", fn_data)
df_data <- read_excel(path_data, sheet = "FileBuild_TTAA")

# Display
cap_data <- "File Builder, Taxa Translator, zip file contents. 'xxxx' represents either 'bugs' or 'fish' depending on chosen OTU. 'yyyymmdd' represents the date when the associated file has last been updated."
knitr::kable(df_data, "html", caption = cap_data)
```

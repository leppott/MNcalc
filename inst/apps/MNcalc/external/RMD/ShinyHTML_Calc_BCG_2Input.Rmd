# Required Fields
The following fields are required in input files. 

Click [here](links/BCGcalc_ReqFields_20230203.xlsx) to download an Excel file 
with this table plus example data.

# Optional Fields
Fields necessary to calculate other metrics can be included and do not affect
the BCG model output.  Additional metrics are available in the '*metval_all.csv'
file.

d3 <- "Habit. Multiple entries are allowed and should be separated with a comma. Entries: burrowers (BU), climbers (CB), clingers (CN), sprawlers (SP), swimmers (SW)."
d4 <- "Noteworthy taxa occur most often at sites with complex and resilient habitat structure that supports high overall freshwater biodiversity. Most of these taxa are rarely or occasionally encountered in benthic macroinvertebrate biomonitoring samples."
d5 <- "These invertebrates require more than one year to complete their life cycles; thus, they are exposed to all the human activities that influence the stream throughout one or more years. If the stream is dry part of the year or subject to flooding, these animals may disappear. Loss of long-lived taxa may also indicate an on-going problem that repeatedly interrupts their life cycles"

Requirements: You do not need R software installed on your computer to
run this Shiny app. You only need an internet connection.

Failure to run: When the Shiny app fails to run, the screen will gray
out and the message ‘disconnected from the server’ will appear. The
problem typically stems from a formatting issue with the input file.
Check your input file, refresh the app and try again. If you still have
problems, contact Erik W. Leppo
([Erik.Leppo\@tetratech.com](mailto:Erik.Leppo@tetratech.com){.email})
and request assistance. Be prepared to share a copy of your input
file(s) and the error message.

Speed: If you have a slow internet connection, you can run the Shiny app
on your local computer (versus online) and it will likely be faster.
Running it locally requires that you have R software and BCGCalc,
BioMonTools and several other R packages installed on your computer,
which can be downloaded for free from GitHub.

Internet browsers: This Shiny app has been tested and run successfully
with Google Chrome, Firefox and Microsoft Edge. It may be compatible
with other browsers but they have not been tested. Google Chrome is most
frequently used. Some browsers (like Chrome and Firefox) allow users to
specify what folder to download files to, which can be a time saver.

Limits on input file: The input file size limit is currently set to 200
MB. This can be increased upon request. The larger the file, the longer
the processing time. If the app is timing out when you try running your
file, try running smaller batches.

Security: Other people cannot see or download your files from the
website. Each time the application is run it is independent from all
other versions. That is, each user has their own copy of the app. Once
the browser is closed, that version is removed from the server along
with all of the uploaded data.

Simultaneous use: Because this Shiny app is on a Shiny server, multiple
people can use it at the same time.

Usability on phones: Mobile use of this app is possible although the
screen size of a phone may make it impractical.

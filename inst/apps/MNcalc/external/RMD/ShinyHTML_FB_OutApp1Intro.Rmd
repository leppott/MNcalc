```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE
                      , results = 'asis'

# Prepare an input file outside of the app

If you choose to create the input file outside of the app (versus using
the ‘File Builder’), go to the subtab for each Calculation (Bug BCG,
Fish BCG, Bug IBI, Fish IBI) to see the required fields. Column names
must match the spelling, symbology and capitalization scheme exactly as
shown.

IMPORTANT: Make sure you are using the proper Operational Taxonomic Unit
(OTU) and taxa traits/attributes for your metric calculations. These can
be found in the
<a href="https://github.com/leppott/BioMonTools_SupportFiles/tree/main/data/taxa_official/MN" target="blank">Taxa
Translator and Attribute tables</a>.

REDUNDANT TAXA: There is a column called EXCLUDE that will be added
automatically when you run the Calculator. The EXCLUDE field marks
redundant (non-distinct) taxa
[<a href="https://github.com/leppott/MNcalc/raw/main/inst/apps/MNcalc/www/links/RedundantTaxa_20240711.pdf" target="blank">PDF</a>].
Redundant taxa are excluded from richness metric calculations but are
included in the composition (percent individuals) metrics.

need to have any familiarity with R.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Internet access*</p></li>
<li><p>Intermediate-level computer skills (need to be able to browse,
upload and download files, unzip files)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For those who prefer to work with R, the functions are carried out by
the
<a href="https://github.com/leppott/BCGcalc" target="_blank">BCGcalc</a>
and
<a href="https://github.com/leppott/BioMonTools" target="_blank">BioMonTools</a>
R packages, which are available on GitHub and were developed by Erik W.
Leppo from Tetra Tech (<a href="#id_0">Erik.Leppo@tetratech.com</a>).</p>
<p>*If using the R code instead of the Shiny app, you wonâ€™t need

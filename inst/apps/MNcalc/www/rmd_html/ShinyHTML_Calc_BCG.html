<p>The PNMR BCG model assigns samples to six levels of biological
condition along a generalized stressor-response curve, ranging from
observable biological conditions found at no or low levels of stressors
(level 1) to those found at high levels of stressors (level 6) (Figure
2). The PNMR model was calibrated for macroinvertebrate communities in
three classes of freshwater wadeable streams: low gradient
(&lt;1%)/lower elevation (&lt;750 m); higher gradient (≥1%)/lower
elevation (&lt;750 m); and higher gradient (≥1%)/higher elevation (≥750
m).</p>
<p>The model is intended to be applied to samples that meet the
following criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Freshwater wadeable streams</p></li>
<li><p>Within the following Omernik Level 3 ecoregions: Coast Range,
Puget Lowland, Willamette Valley, Cascades, and North Cascades,
excluding xeric regions (&lt; 650 mm mean annual precipitation) (Figure
1)</p></li>
<li><p>Total watershed area: 5 to 260 km2 (2 to 100 mi2)</p></li>
<li><p>Target number of organisms: 500. The number of individuals should
not exceed 600; if it does, random subsampling should be
applied</p></li>
<li><p>Sampling effort: at least 8 ft2 sampling area</p></li>
<li><p>Lowest practical taxonomic resolution based on current Standard
Taxonomic Effort guidelines (Wisseman et al. 2015)</p></li>
<li><p>Collection gear: D-Frame kick-nets or Surber net with
500-micrometer mesh net</p></li>
<li><p>Collection method: targeted-riffle or reachwide, multihabitat
(Hayslip 2007)</p></li>
<li><p>Collection period: summer baseflow period (typically June through
mid-October)</p></li>
</ul>

<h1><strong>Preparing input files</strong></h1>
<p>Input files must be comma-separated values (CSV). There are two
options for preparing input files:</p>
<p><strong>Option 1</strong>: Use the File Builder ‘Operational
Taxonomic Unit (OTU) Attribute Assignment’ function to ensure that you
are using the proper taxa attributes for the BCG calculation. See the
<strong>Within the App: File Builder</strong> subtab for details.</p>
<p><strong>Option 2</strong>: Generate a file outside of the Shiny app
that is ready to go (i.e., has all the required fields, with exact
column heading names). See the <strong>Outside the app</strong> subtab
for details.</p>
<p>After you prepare the input file, go to the <strong>Import
Files</strong> tab, upload your input file, and calculate the BCG in the
<strong>Calculation</strong> tab.</p>
